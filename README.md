## Little about me <br>

<li> ☕ Coffee/Cup of tea is a comma for my day</li><br>
<li> 🏋️ CrossFit rejuvenates me🔋</li><br>
<li> Sometimes I enjoy loud volume of music 🎵 and lose myself in music</li><br>
<li> Cannot stay in comfort zone🛏️for long time, I tend to do new things to break out🤯 the comfort zone;<br><t> currently trying running 🏃 3km per day for at least 3 days a week.</li><br>
<li>I 🤔 keep try to maintain balance ⚖️, not being biased.</li><br>

The world 🗺️ will be better place: If we see people as people 🧑‍🤝‍🧑, and see others no different than thyself.
