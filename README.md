## Little about me <br>

<li> ☕ Coffee/Cup of tea is a comma for my day</li><br>
<li> 🏋️ <b>CrossFit</b> rejuvenates me🔋</li><br>
<li> Sometimes I enjoy loud volume of music 🎵 and lose myself in music</li><br>
<li> Cannot stay in comfort zone🛏️for long time, I tend to do new things to break out🤯 the comfort zone;<br><t> currently trying exercise at least four days a week. 🏃 </li><br>
<li> From time to time, I participate in volunteer work such as; Conference crew, CrossFit competition set up crew, planting trees:evergreen_tree:, and teaching code to kids. </li><br>
<li> Sound mind, sound body!</li><br>

The world 🗺️ will be better place: If we see people as people 🧑‍🤝‍🧑, and see others no different than thyself.
